# Security and Testing Guidelines

## Testing Philosophy

- All tests must run in isolated, loopback-only environments
- Use benign commands for testing (e.g., `whoami`, `pwd`, `ls`)
- Clean up test artifacts and logs after testing
- Run as non-privileged users

## Binary Security

- **Rebuild from source**: Always compile on trusted machines
- **No precompiled binaries**: Don't trust distributed executables
- **Clean builds**: Remove build artifacts after testing
- **Secure storage**: Encrypt test logs if they contain sensitive content

## Development Safety

- Use non-privileged accounts for all development
- Implement proper error handling and connection cleanup
- Avoid adding persistence or privilege escalation features
- Treat all input as untrusted
