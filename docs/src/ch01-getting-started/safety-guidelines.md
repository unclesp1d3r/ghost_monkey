# Safety Guidelines

Ghost_Monkey is designed as an educational tool for authorized penetration testing and cybersecurity learning. Following these safety guidelines ensures responsible and legal use.

## Core Safety Principles

### 1. Authorization Only

**Always obtain explicit written authorization** before using Ghost_Monkey:

- ✅ **Authorized**: Your own systems, lab environments, CTF competitions
- ✅ **Authorized**: Client systems with signed penetration testing agreements
- ✅ **Authorized**: Educational environments with instructor permission
- ❌ **Unauthorized**: Any system you don't own or lack explicit permission to test

### 2. Controlled Environments

Start with safe, isolated environments:

- **Localhost Testing**: Begin with `127.0.0.1` connections
- **Virtual Machines**: Use isolated VMs or containers
- **Lab Networks**: Dedicated testing networks separate from production
- **Air-Gapped Systems**: Physically isolated systems when possible

### 3. Non-Privileged Execution

Run Ghost_Monkey with minimal privileges:

```bash
# Good: Run as regular user
./ghost-implant --listen 127.0.0.1:8080

# Avoid: Running as root (unnecessary and dangerous)
sudo ./ghost-implant --listen 0.0.0.0:80
```

## Technical Safety Measures

### Built-in Protections

Ghost_Monkey includes several safety mechanisms:

- **Command Allowlist**: Only `ls`, `pwd`, `whoami` commands permitted
- **Input Validation**: Command length and character restrictions
- **Localhost Binding**: Default binding to `127.0.0.1` only
- **Educational Warnings**: Clear warnings about authorized use
- **No Persistence**: No automatic startup or stealth mechanisms

### Network Safety

#### Recommended Network Configuration

```bash
# Safe: Localhost only
./ghost-implant --listen 127.0.0.1:8080

# Caution: Specific interface
./ghost-implant --listen 192.168.1.100:8080

# Dangerous: All interfaces (avoid in production)
./ghost-implant --listen 0.0.0.0:8080
```

#### Port Selection

- **Unprivileged Ports**: Use ports > 1024 to avoid requiring root
- **Non-Standard Ports**: Avoid well-known service ports (22, 80, 443, etc.)
- **Firewall Considerations**: Ensure appropriate firewall rules

### Data Safety

#### Command Output Handling

- **Size Limits**: Large outputs are automatically truncated
- **Sensitive Data**: Be aware that command outputs may contain sensitive information
- **Logging**: All activities are logged for educational analysis

#### File System Access

Current limitations for safety:

- **Read-Only Operations**: Only directory listing commands allowed
- **No File Transfer**: File upload/download not implemented in basic version
- **Working Directory**: Commands execute in implant's working directory

## Legal and Ethical Guidelines

### Legal Compliance

- **Know Your Laws**: Understand local and international cybersecurity laws
- **Document Authorization**: Keep written permission for all testing
- **Scope Limitations**: Stay within agreed-upon testing scope
- **Data Protection**: Respect privacy and data protection regulations

### Ethical Considerations

- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through proper channels
- **Minimize Impact**: Avoid disrupting normal operations
- **Educational Purpose**: Use for learning, not malicious activities
- **Professional Standards**: Follow industry ethical guidelines

## Development Safety

### Code Safety

When modifying Ghost_Monkey:

```rust
// Good: Input validation
fn validate_command(cmd: &str) -> Result<(), Error> {
    if cmd.len() > MAX_COMMAND_LENGTH {
        return Err(Error::CommandTooLong);
    }
    // Additional validation...
}

// Good: Allowlist approach
const ALLOWED_COMMANDS: &[&str] = &["ls", "pwd", "whoami"];

// Avoid: Blocklist approach (easy to bypass)
const BLOCKED_COMMANDS: &[&str] = &["rm", "dd", "format"];
```

### Testing Safety

- **Isolated Testing**: Use containers or VMs for development
- **Automated Tests**: Rely on unit tests rather than live testing
- **Code Review**: Have others review security-sensitive changes
- **Gradual Deployment**: Test changes incrementally

## Incident Response

### If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Immediate Actions**:

   - Disconnect network connections
   - Stop all Ghost_Monkey processes
   - Document what happened

2. **Assessment**:

   - Determine scope of impact
   - Check logs for activities
   - Assess any data exposure

3. **Reporting**:

   - Notify appropriate authorities if required
   - Follow organizational incident response procedures
   - Document lessons learned

### Emergency Shutdown

Quick commands to stop Ghost_Monkey:

```bash
# Kill all Ghost_Monkey processes
pkill -f ghost-client
pkill -f ghost-implant

# Check for remaining processes
ps aux | grep ghost

# Check network connections
netstat -tulpn | grep ghost
```

## Educational Best Practices

### Learning Environment Setup

1. **Dedicated Lab**: Set up isolated learning environment
2. **Documentation**: Keep detailed notes of activities
3. **Progression**: Start simple, gradually increase complexity
4. **Peer Review**: Work with others for knowledge sharing

### Skill Development

- **Understand Before Using**: Learn the underlying concepts
- **Practice Safely**: Use controlled environments for experimentation
- **Stay Updated**: Keep up with security best practices
- **Professional Development**: Pursue relevant certifications (OSCP, CEH, etc.)
