# Safety Guidelines

This document outlines critical safety guidelines for using Ghost_Monkey in educational and authorized testing environments.

## Ethical Use Requirements

### Legal Compliance

!!! warning "Legal Notice"
    This tool is designed for educational purposes, authorized penetration testing, and OSCP preparation. Users are solely responsible for ensuring lawful use with explicit consent from system owners.

**Required Authorization:**

- Written permission from system owners
- Authorized penetration testing contracts
- Educational lab environments
- Personal test environments with explicit consent

### Educational Context

**Appropriate Use Cases:**

- OSCP lab environments
- Authorized penetration testing
- Educational cybersecurity courses
- Personal learning environments
- Controlled test environments

**Inappropriate Use Cases:**

- Unauthorized system access
- Malicious activities
- Production system testing without permission
- Any illegal activities

## Testing Environment Safety

### Lab-Only Operation

**Network Isolation:**

- Use local firewalls to isolate test traffic
- Configure VLANs for test network separation
- Never expose implant to external networks
- Use loopback interfaces (127.0.0.1) only

**Environment Requirements:**

- Isolated test machines
- Non-production systems only
- Controlled network environments
- Regular security monitoring

### Principle of Least Privilege

**User Account Safety:**

- Run as non-privileged users only
- Avoid root or administrator accounts
- Use dedicated test accounts
- Implement proper access controls

**System Safety:**

- No privilege escalation features
- No persistence mechanisms
- No stealth capabilities
- Visible and detectable operation

## Binary and Data Hygiene

### Source Code Security

**Rebuild from Source:**

- Always compile on trusted machines
- Never use precompiled binaries without verification
- Verify source code integrity
- Use clean build environments

**Build Artifact Management:**

- Clean build artifacts after testing
- Remove temporary files and logs
- Secure storage of test data
- Regular cleanup procedures

### Test Data Handling

**Sensitive Information:**

- Avoid logging sensitive data
- Use benign commands for testing
- Encrypt test logs if necessary
- Implement data retention policies

**Cleanup Procedures:**

- Delete test outputs when no longer needed
- Remove temporary files
- Clear system logs if necessary
- Secure disposal of test data

## Command Safety Guidelines

### Safe Testing Commands

**System Information (Safe):**

```bash
whoami
pwd
id
uname -a
hostname
```

**File Operations (Safe):**

```bash
ls -la
cat /etc/os-release
head -5 /etc/passwd
find /tmp -name "*.log" 2>/dev/null
```

**Network Information (Local Only):**

```bash
ip addr show
netstat -tuln
ss -tuln
```

### Commands to Avoid

**Dangerous Commands (NEVER USE):**

```bash
# System destruction
rm -rf /
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda

# System shutdown
shutdown -h now
halt
poweroff

# Privilege escalation
sudo su -
su -
```

**Potentially Harmful Commands:**

```bash
# File system operations
rm -rf /home/*
chmod -R 777 /
chown -R root:root /

# Network operations
iptables -F
ufw disable
```

## Development Safety

### Code Review Security

**Security Checklist:**

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] No external network connections
- [ ] No file system persistence
- [ ] No privilege escalation
- [ ] No stealth features
- [ ] Proper input validation

**Code Quality:**

- Clear error messages without information disclosure
- Proper input sanitization
- No sensitive data in logs
- Secure coding practices

### Testing Safety

**Test Environment:**

- Isolated from production systems
- No external network access
- Controlled user permissions
- Regular security monitoring

**Test Procedures:**

- Use benign commands only
- Monitor system resources
- Clean up after testing
- Document test procedures

## Incident Response
