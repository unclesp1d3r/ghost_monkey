# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the core networking protocol for Ghost_Monkey, establishing secure communication between a client and implant using the `network-protocol` crate. The implementation focuses on creating a minimal viable communication system that can execute a single command (`ls`) to demonstrate the foundational networking and cryptographic capabilities. This serves as the building block for all future Ghost_Monkey functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a penetration tester, I want to establish a secure connection between the client and implant, so that I can communicate safely without exposing sensitive data over the network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the client initiates a connection to the implant THEN the system SHALL establish a TCP connection using the network-protocol crate
2. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL perform an ECDH key exchange using X25519 for secure communication
3. WHEN the key exchange completes THEN the system SHALL encrypt all subsequent messages using ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD
4. IF the key exchange fails THEN the system SHALL terminate the connection and log the failure
5. WHEN the connection is active THEN the system SHALL implement heartbeat mechanisms to detect connection loss

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a penetration tester, I want to send commands from the client to the implant, so that I can execute operations on the target system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the client sends a command message THEN the system SHALL serialize it using the network-protocol PacketCodec
2. WHEN the implant receives a command message THEN the system SHALL decrypt and deserialize it correctly
3. WHEN a command is "ls" THEN the implant SHALL execute the directory listing command safely
4. IF the command is not "ls" THEN the implant SHALL reject it and return an error message
5. WHEN command execution completes THEN the implant SHALL send the output back to the client

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a penetration tester, I want to receive command results from the implant, so that I can see the output of executed operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the implant executes a command THEN the system SHALL capture both stdout and stderr output
2. WHEN command output is ready THEN the implant SHALL encrypt and send it to the client
3. WHEN the client receives output THEN the system SHALL decrypt and display it to the user
4. IF command execution fails THEN the implant SHALL send an error message with details
5. WHEN output exceeds 4KB THEN the system SHALL chunk the response into multiple packets

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the system to operate safely in educational environments, so that it cannot be misused for malicious purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the implant starts THEN the system SHALL bind to the specified interface (configurable, defaulting to all interfaces)
2. WHEN processing commands THEN the system SHALL validate input length and reject oversized commands
3. WHEN executing commands THEN the system SHALL run with current user privileges only
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL display educational warnings about authorized use only
5. WHEN handling network connections THEN the system SHALL implement reasonable timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues and understand system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any network error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information using the tracing crate
2. WHEN cryptographic operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages without exposing sensitive data
3. WHEN connection timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle reconnection attempts
4. IF message parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other messages
5. WHEN the system encounters unexpected states THEN it SHALL log warnings and attempt recovery

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a penetration tester, I want both call-in and callback connection modes, so that I can adapt to different network environments and firewall configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in call-in mode THEN the implant SHALL listen on a specified port for client connections
2. WHEN running in callback mode THEN the implant SHALL connect to a listening client
3. WHEN the client runs in listen mode THEN it SHALL accept incoming connections from implants
4. WHEN the client runs in connect mode THEN it SHALL initiate connections to listening implants
5. WHEN either mode is active THEN the same protocol and security measures SHALL apply

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive development tooling and testing infrastructure, so that I can build, test, and benchmark the system effectively across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL use tokio as the async runtime for all networking operations
2. WHEN building for different platforms THEN the system SHALL support cross-platform builds using cargo-zigbuild
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use nextest for faster and more reliable test execution
4. WHEN testing protocol behavior THEN the system SHALL use insta for snapshot testing of message serialization and protocol flows
5. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL use criterion for benchmarking network throughput and cryptographic operations
6. WHEN testing with random inputs THEN the system SHALL use proptest for property-based testing of protocol edge cases
7. WHEN ensuring security robustness THEN the system SHALL include fuzzing tests for message parsing and cryptographic operations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer and learner, I want comprehensive documentation that explains both the code and the concepts, so that the project serves as an effective educational resource.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code THEN every public function and module SHALL have rustdoc comments with examples and explanations
2. WHEN implementing complex algorithms THEN private functions SHALL include rustdoc comments explaining the approach and reasoning
3. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL include an mdbook configuration for comprehensive tutorial documentation
4. WHEN documenting networking concepts THEN the mdbook SHALL include chapters on TCP, QUIC, and the network-protocol crate usage
5. WHEN documenting cryptography THEN the mdbook SHALL explain ChaCha20-Poly1305, X25519 key exchange, and security considerations
6. WHEN generating documentation THEN both `cargo doc` and `mdbook build` SHALL produce complete, linked documentation
7. WHEN updating code THEN corresponding documentation SHALL be updated to maintain accuracy
